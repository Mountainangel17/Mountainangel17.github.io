      <h3>You may ask yourself...well, how did I get here?!</h3>
      <p>I started out my adult version with the expectation of being a field photographer for <b>Life</b> magazine.</p>
      <p>At the end of my junior year at college I was informed that my financial aid was to be eliminated, thanks to the shakedown occuring in Washington via the Whitehouse. A shakedown fondly termed <i>Reaganomics</i>. </p>
      <p>In a heated moment I decided to join the military, my logic being that the GI Bill would help me finish my degree in photojournalism.</p>
      <p>I signed up to be an Air Traffic Controller because the technology of the work appealed to me. The day that I finished Basic Training I was handed orders to go to school to be a combat medic/radiologic technologist. I was horrified, there was nothing I could imagine doing less! I did not consider myself a healthcare-type individual. This was the day that I learned that my mother was an illegal alien, and because of that I was not eligible for top secret clearance...and that job.</p>
      <p><img src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_hJq1e8pQ1pWFRmTUNxQ3R6MEU/view" alt="W3C logo" width="200" height="136" class="flowLeft">So that is what I did for 32 years. Kids and mortgages and divorce and life happened and it was simply not economically feasible to be anything but a medical imaging specialist, and x-ray tech, while I was the single mom of 4 kids.</p>
      <p> While the W3C was taking HTML down the XHTML path, a group of authors, developers, and organizations became frustrated with the lack of progress on updating HTML. This group decided to evolve HTML independently of the W3C and formed the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (or <b>WHATWG</b>) in 2004. They began work on the Web Applications 1.0 standard, which extended HTML 4.0, adding clear parsing rules for user agents and creating APIs to make developing web applications easier. The W3C, realizing that XHTML 2.0 faced significant hurdles in adoption, began working with the WHATWG and began to jointly develop the new standard with them in 2008. Currently the W3C works on publishing a stable version of the specification, while the WHATWG continues to work on what they call a &ldquo;living standard&rdquo; of the specification. As a living standard, they&rsquo;ve removed the version number and simply refer to it as &ldquo;HTML.&rdquo;</p>
