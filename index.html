      <h3>You may ask yourself...well, how did I get here?!</h3>
      <p>I started out my adult version with the expectation of being a field photographer for <b>Life</b> magazine.</p>
      <p>At the end of my junior year at college I was informed that my financial aid was to be eliminated, thanks to the shakedown occuring in Washington via the Whitehouse. A shakedown fondly termed <i>Reaganomics</i>. </p>
      <p>In a heated moment I decided to join the military, my logic being that the GI Bill would help me finish my degree in photojournalism.</p>
      <p>I signed up to be an Air Traffic Controller because the technology of the work appealed to me. The day that I finished Basic Training I was handed orders to go to school to be a combat medic/radiologic technologist. I was horrified, there was nothing I could imagine doing less! I did not consider myself a healthcare-type individual. This was the day that I learned that my mother was an illegal alien, and because of that I was not eligible for top secret clearance...and that job.</p>
      <p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8a/39/20/8a3920ff9b2350a69bcbddc98e77ae61--angel-s-angel-wings.jpg" alt="Grounded Angel" width="310" height="375" class="flowLeft">So that is what I did for 32 years. Kids and mortgages and divorce and life happened and it was simply not economically feasible to be anything but a medical imaging specialist, and x-ray tech, while I was the single mom of 4 kids.</p>
      <p> In 2013 I fell. I had been working with a very damaged back since 1986 when I was hurt in the military...but when I fell it knocked my back completely out of alignment permanently and I lost all feeling in my right leg. I was forced to retire from my medical career because I walked with a cane and there are physical requirements to the job. I was forced to recreate myself and in doing so I have reverted back to the old creative person I was 3 decades ago. I lost my house and am living very humbly. I have learned that when you have nothing left to lose...you discover how much you really have.</p>

      <h3>Why Web Development?</h3>
      <p>This is a very different world than the one where my dreams lie. Magazines and newspapers are essentially gone. The internet and the communications that have evolved with it are the reality now. I am still intrigued by the technology, and frankly super excited by where photography has evolved to. But I have so much to learn! The journey ahead of me is long and will be very bumpy, but expanding on what I love and not what I <b>need</b> to do will make the journey on of personal fullfillment and immense satisfaction.</p>
